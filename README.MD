Hello! I am Max, a highschool student with a love for learning of all sorts - machine, deep, or academic. I generally work on python machine learning projects, though I do know numerous other languages.
I am currently learning all that I can about large language models and I hope to crack into MMMs soon if I can. I am limited by my singular RTX 3060 GPU, but I consider it a blessing in disguise, as it teaches / forces me to write memory optimized code. 
One of my favorite projects was Adalpha. It is a new optimizer for machine learning systems to avoid mode collapse. Currently it is only availible in keras. Upon request, I can work on porting Adalpha to Pytorch as that is what I mainly use now, but I simply do not have the time to do it fruitlessly. 


My current main project is Astrolabe, a vision processing system for FRC robots. It is pretty cool - check it out!
I am looking for internships in Northern Nevada, Reno, Carson City, Sparks, etc. Enjoy!
